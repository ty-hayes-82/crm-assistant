## Architecture

### ADK Framework Integration

The Project Manager Agent is built on the Google ADK framework, following the same patterns as the CRM Agent:

```python
# ADK-compliant agent structure
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent

class ProjectManagerAgent(LlmAgent):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(
            name="ProjectManagerAgent",
            model='gemini-2.5-flash',
            instruction="...",
            **kwargs
        )
```

### A2A Communication

The agent uses the CRM Agent Registry for seamless integration:

```python
from crm_agent.core.factory import crm_agent_registry

# Register available agents
self.orchestrator.register_agent("company_intelligence", 
    lambda: crm_agent_registry.create_agent("company_intelligence"))
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from project_manager_agent import create_project_manager

# Create the agent
pm_agent = create_project_manager()

# Execute a goal
result = await pm_agent.execute_goal(
    "Find all golf clubs in Arizona and enrich their records"
)

print(f"Status: {result['status']}")
print(f"Progress: {result['progress']}%")
print(f"Tasks: {result['completed_tasks']}/{result['total_tasks']}")
```

### With Context

```python
# Provide additional context
context = {
    "company_domain": "mansionridgegc.com",
    "current_data": {
        "management_company": "",
        "description": ""
    }
}

result = await pm_agent.execute_goal(
    "Analyze The Golf Club at Mansion Ridge",
    context=context
)
```

### ADK Integration

```python
# For ADK discovery
from project_manager_agent.agent import root_agent

# The agent is automatically available to ADK
agent = root_agent
```
