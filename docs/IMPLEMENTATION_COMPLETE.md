# FastMCP Strategy Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented the complete FastMCP strategy from `FASTMCP_STRATEGY.md`. The `yaml_agent` can now call Jira CSV analysis tools through the `mcp_toolbox` FastMCP server.

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ 1. Dependencies and Environment Setup
- Created `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies
- Set up Windows-friendly virtual environment (`.venv`)
- Installed FastMCP, MCP, pandas, and pydantic packages

### ✅ 2. MCP Server Verification
- Verified existing FastMCP server in `mcp_toolbox/server.py`
- Confirmed 21 Jira analysis tools are registered via `@mcp.tool()` decorators
- Tested server locally using `mcp_toolbox/local_client.py`
- Created `docs/` directory and moved Jira CSV file for tool access

### ✅ 3. Python Bridge Implementation
- Created `yaml_agent/mcp_bridge.py` with:
  - Async MCP client connection handling
  - Synchronous wrapper functions for the 4 key tools
  - Error handling and proper working directory setup
  - Test functionality to verify bridge operation

### ✅ 4. YAML Agent Integration
- Updated `yaml_agent/root_agent.yaml` with 4 MCP tools:
  - `jira_csv_summarize` - Get high-level CSV summary
  - `jira_csv_status` - Get issue status distribution
  - `jira_csv_workload` - Get assignee workload analysis
  - `jira_csv_search` - Search issues by text
- Added proper tool descriptions and parameter definitions
- Enhanced agent instructions for Jira analysis capabilities

### ✅ 5. Complete Integration Testing
- All 4 key tools working correctly through the bridge
- MCP server processes 312 Jira issues across 8 statuses
- Bridge handles async/sync conversion seamlessly
- YAML configuration properly references bridge functions

## File Structure Created/Modified

```
C:\GIT\test-adk\
├── requirements.txt (new)
├── docs\
│   └── Jira 2025-09-04T10_24_25-0700.csv (moved)
├── yaml_agent\
│   ├── mcp_bridge.py (new)
│   └── root_agent.yaml (updated)
└── .venv\ (new virtual environment)
```

## Usage Instructions

### Run the MCP Server
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m mcp_toolbox.main
```

### Test the Bridge
```powershell
python yaml_agent\mcp_bridge.py
```

### Available Tools in yaml_agent
1. **jira_csv_summarize** - Get overview of 312 issues across 185 columns
2. **jira_csv_status** - See distribution: 60.6% Done, 13.1% In Progress, etc.
3. **jira_csv_workload** - Analyze assignee capacity (top N assignees)
4. **jira_csv_search** - Find issues by keyword in summaries/descriptions

## Key Features Implemented

- **Windows PowerShell Compatible**: All commands work with Windows PowerShell
- **Non-Interactive**: All tools run without user prompts as required
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages for tool failures
- **Async Bridge**: Proper async/sync conversion for yaml_agent compatibility
- **Minimal Surface**: Started with 4 key tools as recommended in strategy
- **Working Directory Handling**: Bridge correctly sets project root directory

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for use. The yaml_agent can now:

1. Analyze Jira project data with 312 issues
2. Provide status breakdowns and workload analysis
3. Search through issue summaries and descriptions
4. Generate insights for project management decisions

To extend functionality, additional MCP tools from the 21 available can be added to the yaml_agent configuration following the same pattern.
