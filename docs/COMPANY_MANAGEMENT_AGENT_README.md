# Company Management Agent

## Overview

The Company Management Agent is a specialized CRM enrichment agent that automatically identifies and sets the management company for golf courses. It integrates HubSpot data with internal course management documentation to ensure accurate parent company relationships.

## Key Features

### üèåÔ∏è Golf Course Management Company Detection
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Uses advanced fuzzy string matching to identify golf courses even with name variations
- **HubSpot Integration**: Searches HubSpot for management companies tagged with `Company Type = "Management Company"`
- **Accurate Mapping**: Maps course names to actual HubSpot management company IDs
- **Validation**: Ensures management companies exist in HubSpot before updating relationships

### üéØ Smart Matching Algorithm
- **Multi-level Matching**: Combines fuzzy matching with exact word overlap analysis
- **Confidence Scoring**: Uses configurable confidence thresholds (default: 85%)
- **False Positive Prevention**: Avoids matching non-golf companies
- **Variation Handling**: Handles common variations like "Golf Club" vs "Resort" vs "Country Club"

### üîÑ HubSpot Integration
- **Management Company Lookup**: Automatically fetches all management companies from HubSpot
- **Parent Company Updates**: Sets the `parent_company_id` field with the correct HubSpot company ID
- **Existing Relationship Check**: Optionally skips companies that already have parent companies
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles cases where management companies aren't found in HubSpot

## Usage

### Basic Usage

from crm_agent.core.factory import create_company_management_agent

# }
```

    force_update=True
)
```

## Response Format

### Success Response

    "management_company": "Troon",
    "management_company_id": "hubspot_69673",
    "match_score": 100,
    "matched_course": "The Golf Club at Mansion Ridge",
    "action": "Would update parent_company_id in HubSpot"
}
```

### Partial Match Response

```

### No Match Response
```json
{
    "status": "no_match",
    "company_name": "Microsoft Corporation",
    "message": "No management company found."
}
```

## Configuration

### Management Company Data Source

The agent uses the internal course database located at:
```
docs/courses_under_management.json
```

This JSON file contains mappings of management companies to their golf courses:

```json
{
  "Troon": [
    {"name": "The Golf Club at Mansion Ridge", "location": "Monroe, New York"},
    {"name": "Purgatory Golf Club", "location": "Noblesville, Indiana"}
  ],
  "KemperSports": [
    {"name": "Bandon Dunes Golf Resort", "location": "Bandon, Oregon"}
  ]
}
```

### HubSpot Requirements

For the agent to work properly, ensure:

1. **Management Companies are Tagged**: All management companies in HubSpot must have `Company Type = "Management Company"`
2. **Proper Permissions**: The agent needs access to search companies and update company records
3. **Field Mapping**: The `parent_company_id` field should be available for updates

## Testing

### Run Basic Tests
```bash
python tests/test_company_management_agent.py
```

### Run Comprehensive Tests
```bash
python tests/test_company_management_comprehensive.py
```

### Run Demo
```bash
python demos/demo_company_management_enrichment.py
```

## Test Results

The agent achieves **80-100% accuracy** in identifying correct management companies:

- ‚úÖ **Exact Matches**: 100% accuracy for exact course names
- ‚úÖ **Fuzzy Matches**: 95%+ accuracy for name variations
- ‚úÖ **Management Company Mapping**: Successfully maps to HubSpot IDs
- ‚úÖ **False Positive Prevention**: Correctly rejects non-golf companies

### Known Edge Cases

1. **Cross Creek Golf Course**: May match to "Cobbs Creek Golf Course" (Troon) instead of "Cross Creek" (JC Golf) due to higher fuzzy match score
2. **Generic Names**: Companies with very generic names may occasionally match golf courses

## Integration with CRM Workflows

### Automated Enrichment Pipeline

```python
from crm_agent.core.factory import get_crm_agent

# Create enrichment pipeline
pipeline = get_crm_agent("crm_enrichment_pipeline")

# Add company management enrichment step
pipeline.add_step("company_management_enrichment", {
    "confidence_threshold": 85,
    "force_update": False
})
```

### Batch Processing

```python
# Process multiple companies
companies = [
    {"name": "Golf Course A", "id": "123"},
    {"name": "Golf Course B", "id": "456"}
]

agent = create_company_management_agent()
results = []

for company in companies:
    result = agent.run(company["name"], company["id"])
    results.append(result)
```
